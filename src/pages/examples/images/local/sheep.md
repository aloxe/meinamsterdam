## A picture of sheep

This is an example page with photo of sheep that sits in the same folder as the current page.

It is possible to display the image giving the entire path to the file as bellow.

```markdown
![drooderfiets and sheep](/examples/images/local/sheep.jpg)
```

While this may help you understand where the file is, it is less practical in the CMS as the image will not be visible in the editor. Though it will still display in the page. You will also note that the thumbnail only accept the relative path.

![drooderfiets and sheep](/examples/images/local/sheep.jpg)
