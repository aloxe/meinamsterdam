Hi,
<br/><br/>
This morning on the radio a police officer told that the coming period
they will stricter on lights at your bike.
<br/><br/>
Lights have to be attached to nothing else than your bike, so he said.
<br/><br/>
I thought you might want to know this at forehand..:-)
<br/><br/>
Cheers, Math
