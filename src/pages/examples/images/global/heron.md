## Picture of a heron

This is an example page with the image of a heron that was uploaded in a subfolder of the global media folder (Uncategorized). It is accessible from any page. The resulting Markdown code is:

```markdown
![drooderfiets and grasshopper](/img/animals/heron.jpg)
```

![drooderfiets and grasshopper](/img/animals/heron.jpg)

Images from global folders can be used on all pages but they won't appear on the editor. Though, they will be displayed on the final page.
