<b>Fairtrade chocolate letter campaign pays off</b>

</p><p>
It is the festive season in the Netherlands and a Green Saint campaign by Oxfam Novib to encourage people to only buy fair trade chocolate looks like it is paying off. The Dutch traditionally give each other a chocolate letter, and other presents on the eve of Saint Nicolas Day on  5 December. This year, Oxfam Novib is using an aggressive advertising campaign to put pressure on shops to only stock fair trade chocolate letters.

The name and shame campaign singles out which companies have and which have not stocked fair trade chocolate letters. NRC.next reports that a number of companies have announced they will soon be selling fair trade chocolate, but not because of the Green Saint campaign. The chain stores which plan to stock them in the future, say they were already working on the issue before the campaign.

They also complain that Oxfam Novib is creating the impression that all other chocolate is produced using child labour or environmentally unfriendly methods, which they dispute. At the same time they argue that not enough fair trade cacao is being produced. Part of the problem is that the companies are dealing with small farmers and it takes time to train them on environmentally friendly methods and social working conditions.

A spokesperson for Oxfam Novib says Its a vicious circle, companies have been telling us for years that are working on the problem. But we want to see real commitment. Anyway its up to the consumers now to vote with their feet. </p>
