<p>AD runs front-page pictures of the chaos caused by what it calls yesterday's autumn storm that raced across the country. In one photo, scaffolding, four storeys high, is shown torn from a block of flats by the high winds in Hoogeveen. In another, the rear section of a juggernaut lorry hangs precariously over a ditch having been blown from a road in Zwartsluis.<br />

The paper relieves us with the news that not too much damage was done. Motorists suffered because of rush-hour delays, but some people appear to have enjoyed the dramatic weather. A man is pictured braving the lashing sand and wind, jogging along the Hoek van Holland coast.</p>
