<b>Bike lights on clothes not acceptable</b>
<br/><br/>
 30 October 2007
<br/><br/>
THE HAGUE Â– The police will be holding stricter checks for bicycle lights this autumn. Lights worn on clothing or clipped onto bags will no longer be accepted. Blinking bike lights can also result in a fine.
<br/><br/>
The council of police commissioners has sent all police forces a letter instructing them to enforce the law consistently. "That means that lights that are not affixed to the bicycle are history," said a spokesperson for the council on Tuesday after reports in numerous morning newspapers. "A white light must be on the front of the bicycle, a red one must be on the back."
<br/><br/>
The fine for improper lighting is EUR 20. Police do have the latitude to issue a warning first, for instance if a cyclist does have lights but they are not affixed properly to the bicycle.
<br/><br/>
Until now some police forces accepted lights worn on the clothing or clipped to bags as long as they were clearly visible. The commissioners want to put an end to this and are calling on all police departments to enforce the law uniformly.
