Everyone accuses everyone else of lack of consideration

Saturdays NRC Handelsblad looks at the problem of asocial behaviour from a different angle. The article, accompanied by a drawing of a tulip and two windmills with middle fingers sticking out of them, writes that there is "a growing lack of respect, common decency and tolerance. More than 90 percent of the Dutch think that other Dutch are too egocentric. This is both tragic and comic  everyone accuses everyone else of a lack of consideration There is never a trace of self-criticism. Other people are always the ones who should change their behaviour."
