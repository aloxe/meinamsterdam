<p>
This is not quite the same as other news that I've heard, which added a bit more nuance:
<br/><br/>
The police in Amsterdam is of the opinion that they're glad people have light at all, be it blinking, attached to their hairdo or whatever, and always interpreted the law a bit liberal in this regard.
<br/><br/>
Some national council op police commissioners hasn't been happy with this for some time. They started complaining again about Amsterdam's liberal interpretation, this time involving the media. So far the response from Amsterdam has been that they can go stuff themselves.
<br/><br/>
That doesn't mean they're not still out in force to fill their ticket quota with the assistence of people who have no light at all, of course.
