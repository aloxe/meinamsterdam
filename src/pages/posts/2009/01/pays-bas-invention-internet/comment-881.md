<p>Dear Alix,</p>
<p><br />we want to thank you for your participation in our New Years event at<br />Felix Meritis on Jan 16th, and hope you have enjoyed yourself as much<br />as we have. It was great to see the local internet community brought<br />together in one venue to celebrate the new year and the good work we<br />are all doing. We heard lightning talks on some fascinating issues such<br />as cybercrime, the semantic web, accessibility and so on. We enjoyed the<br />Chairmans' debate and the company of many old friends and<br />acquaintances, met interesting new people and had a good time<br />altogether.</p>
<p><br />Which is why we already started organising next years event, and plan<br />to make it even better. We have received valuable comments already. If<br />you also have suggestions, any at all, please let us know. And please<br />mark your calendar for:<br />the 2010 New Years party on Thursday January 14th 2010.<br />On behalf of the organisers,<br />Michiel Leenaars and Sandra Gijzen<br />P.S. If you can't wait that long, you might be interested in the first<br />European Mozcamp that will be hosted in Utrecht at SURFnet and is<br />organised by NLLGG, Internet Society Netherlands, W3C, Mozilla Europe<br />and others. See: <img alt="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCamp/Utrecht" src="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCamp/Utrecht" /></p>
<p><br />In the rest of this mail we want to supply you with the answers to questions such as.<br />* I saw camera's. Where are the pictures?<br />* Can I get the slides of the lightning talks?<br />* What does that T-shirt I got mean?<br />* I forgot to get my free ENUM account, now what?<br />* There was something about a discount<br />* Can I register for next year already?<br />* Thanks a bunch to ...<br />I SAW CAMERA'S. WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?<br />Thanks to Miriam van der Have, both board member of OpenDoc Society and<br />member of Internet Society Netherlands, we have quite a large amount of<br />nice professional images from the event itself. You can find them here:<br />http://isoc.nl/img/2009-ny/foto.htm<br />(or alternatively at:<br />http://www.flickr.com/photos/newwws/sets/72157612852313551 )<br />You are free to use them for whatever (non-commercial) purpose you<br />like, please have the courtesy to include a proper reference. If you<br />have more pictures, we can put them online as well.<br />CAN I GET THE SLIDES OF THE LIGHTNING TALKS?<br />Yes you can. You can find all the slides on the Internet Society<br />website:<br />http://isoc.nl/activ/2009-newyear.htm<br />In fact, if you really like slides: we even posted all the New Years<br />messages that were shown on the main screen to the website here:<br />http://isoc.nl/img/2009-ny<br />So if you are interested in one of the job openings, or forgot to write<br />the name of that game accessibility website - just look it up.<br />WHAT DOES THAT T-SHIRT I GOT MEAN?<br />Hopefully you picked up a T-shirt in the patio where we had about 400<br />of these cool T-shirts to give away in all sizes. The back of the shirt<br />contained the oldest drawing known of the ARPANET, drawn 40 years ago<br />on a napkin this september. It shows the first two nodes of this<br />historical precursor to the internet. The graphic on the front side<br />contains two elements: the first is the 'universally applicable<br />fingerprint' of German minister of the interior Wolfgang Schauble, as<br />published by the German hackers from Chaos Computer Club last year as<br />part of the societal debate on including biometric data in identity<br />documents. The second is the famous 'fork bomb' poem by Amsterdam based<br />writer, programmer and activist Jaromil. In just thirteen attractive<br />characters of shell code you will find enough recursive power to bring<br />any UNIX-based system to a halt - and it looks pretty too. You work out<br />what that means, if anything.<br />We still have some extra shirts. If you join ISOC now (or indicated you<br />will join ISOC when you registered and send us a mail that you didn't<br />get your shirt at the event), we'll send you one. Get it while stocks<br />last, please indicate your preferred size&nbsp; when you mail us at<br />ny2009@isoc.nl<br />I FORGOT TO GET MY FREE USER ENUM ACCOUNT.<br />With all those kind people, free drinks and talks you may have<br />forgotten to get your free ENUM account from the nice people at SIDN.<br />ENUM is basically a way to bridge telephony with the internet world -<br />actually anything a device running over the internet may want to know<br />about you when dialing your number. This includes your VoIP<br />reachability, instant messaging, real time text capacity, geographical<br />coordinates or where you publish your home page, twitter feed or GPG<br />key. If you are a developer, SIDN will be glad to help you to<br />understand this technology and create exiting applications for it. If<br />you are a consumer, get it and see what will happen with this pretty<br />interesting technology without any risk or cost - so that next year you<br />will be one of those people that can claim to be one of the first 500<br />people working with this new internet standard here in the Netherlands.<br />Now for those of you from abroad, sorry, you can only register Dutch<br />phone numbers (but if you want you can ask someone here to buy a local<br />SIM card for your cell phone and it'll work for you as well).<br />SIDN has extended the period in which you register an account up to<br />February 16th. This can be done by sending an email with your contact<br />details to: support@enum.nl.<br />THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A DISCOUNT<br />Hxx foundation, organisers of the upcoming Hacking at Random conference<br />in August this year, were so friendly as to promise all the<br />participants of this new years event a discount to their hacker<br />conference extra-ordinaire. HAR is the celebratory fifth installment of<br />a major international conference held every four year in the<br />Netherlands. There will be thousands of IT-securityprofessionals<br />flocking to Vierhouten to look at criticial security issues on the<br />internet, but you will have the privilige of having paid less than them<br />if you claim your 5 euro discount with the code ISOC.<br />Register at: http://www.har2009.org<br />CAN I REGISTER FOR NEXT YEAR ALREADY?<br />Sure you can. Just go to http://isoc.nl/registratie as you did before.<br />The event will take place on January 14th 2009, and the venue will be<br />Pakhuis de Zwijger.<br />THANKS A BUNCH TO ...<br />We want to thank Jeroen Bulten, Dick Bulterman, Ivan Herman, Koen<br />Martens, Tom Peelen, Steven Pemberton, Eric Velleman, Ruud Vriens,<br />Annemarie Zielstra for their lightning talks.

We want to thank all the sponsors -<br />AMS-ix, AT computing, DHPA, ISPconnect, Internet Society Netherlands,<br />Gridforum.nl, NLnet, Rednose, RIPE NCC, SIDN, SURFnet and TERENA.
