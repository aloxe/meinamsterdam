<p>The image of Anne Frank with the keffieh was originally printed on free postcards named Boomerang Cards and spread to restaurants, bars, cinema's, libraries and schools througout the Netherlands. The image was created by an artist named T. (or T. 2008). A a postcard it created a bit of a political stir because the Centre for Information and Documentation Israel (CIDI) reacted in anger, saying it was historically incorrect and abusive. The artist responded - via Boomerang - that he didn't see it that way: he painted it as a hopeful image about future peace between Israel and Palestine. </p>
