Dear Alix,


we want to thank you for your participation in our New Years event at
Felix Meritis on Jan 16th, and hope you have enjoyed yourself as much
as we have. It was great to see the local internet community brought
together in one venue to celebrate the new year and the good work we
are all doing. We heard lightning talks on some fascinating issues such
as cybercrime, the semantic web, accessibility and so on. We enjoyed the
Chairmans' debate and the company of many old friends and
acquaintances, met interesting new people and had a good time
altogether.


Which is why we already started organising next years event, and plan
to make it even better. We have received valuable comments already. If
you also have suggestions, any at all, please let us know. And please
mark your calendar for:
the 2010 New Years party on Thursday January 14th 2010.
On behalf of the organisers,
Michiel Leenaars and Sandra Gijzen
P.S. If you can't wait that long, you might be interested in the first
European Mozcamp that will be hosted in Utrecht at SURFnet and is
organised by NLLGG, Internet Society Netherlands, W3C, Mozilla Europe
and others. See: https://wiki.mozilla.org/MozCamp/Utrecht

<!-- TODO: sort this out
In the rest of this mail we want to supply you with the answers to questions such as.
* I saw camera's. Where are the pictures?
* Can I get the slides of the lightning talks?
* What does that T-shirt I got mean?
* I forgot to get my free ENUM account, now what?
* There was something about a discount
* Can I register for next year already?
* Thanks a bunch to ...
I SAW CAMERA'S. WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?
Thanks to Miriam van der Have, both board member of OpenDoc Society and
member of Internet Society Netherlands, we have quite a large amount of
nice professional images from the event itself. You can find them here:
http://isoc.nl/img/2009-ny/foto.htm
(or alternatively at:
http://www.flickr.com/photos/newwws/sets/72157612852313551 )
You are free to use them for whatever (non-commercial) purpose you
like, please have the courtesy to include a proper reference. If you
have more pictures, we can put them online as well.
CAN I GET THE SLIDES OF THE LIGHTNING TALKS?
Yes you can. You can find all the slides on the Internet Society
website:
http://isoc.nl/activ/2009-newyear.htm
In fact, if you really like slides: we even posted all the New Years
messages that were shown on the main screen to the website here:
http://isoc.nl/img/2009-ny
So if you are interested in one of the job openings, or forgot to write
the name of that game accessibility website - just look it up.
WHAT DOES THAT T-SHIRT I GOT MEAN?
Hopefully you picked up a T-shirt in the patio where we had about 400
of these cool T-shirts to give away in all sizes. The back of the shirt
contained the oldest drawing known of the ARPANET, drawn 40 years ago
on a napkin this september. It shows the first two nodes of this
historical precursor to the internet. The graphic on the front side
contains two elements: the first is the 'universally applicable
fingerprint' of German minister of the interior Wolfgang Schauble, as
published by the German hackers from Chaos Computer Club last year as
part of the societal debate on including biometric data in identity
documents. The second is the famous 'fork bomb' poem by Amsterdam based
writer, programmer and activist Jaromil. In just thirteen attractive
characters of shell code you will find enough recursive power to bring
any UNIX-based system to a halt - and it looks pretty too. You work out
what that means, if anything.
We still have some extra shirts. If you join ISOC now (or indicated you
will join ISOC when you registered and send us a mail that you didn't
get your shirt at the event), we'll send you one. Get it while stocks
last, please indicate your preferred size  when you mail us at
ny2009@isoc.nl
I FORGOT TO GET MY FREE USER ENUM ACCOUNT.
With all those kind people, free drinks and talks you may have
forgotten to get your free ENUM account from the nice people at SIDN.
ENUM is basically a way to bridge telephony with the internet world -
actually anything a device running over the internet may want to know
about you when dialing your number. This includes your VoIP
reachability, instant messaging, real time text capacity, geographical
coordinates or where you publish your home page, twitter feed or GPG
key. If you are a developer, SIDN will be glad to help you to
understand this technology and create exiting applications for it. If
you are a consumer, get it and see what will happen with this pretty
interesting technology without any risk or cost - so that next year you
will be one of those people that can claim to be one of the first 500
people working with this new internet standard here in the Netherlands.
Now for those of you from abroad, sorry, you can only register Dutch
phone numbers (but if you want you can ask someone here to buy a local
SIM card for your cell phone and it'll work for you as well).
SIDN has extended the period in which you register an account up to
February 16th. This can be done by sending an email with your contact
details to: support@enum.nl.
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT A DISCOUNT
Hxx foundation, organisers of the upcoming Hacking at Random conference
in August this year, were so friendly as to promise all the
participants of this new years event a discount to their hacker
conference extra-ordinaire. HAR is the celebratory fifth installment of
a major international conference held every four year in the
Netherlands. There will be thousands of IT-securityprofessionals
flocking to Vierhouten to look at criticial security issues on the
internet, but you will have the privilige of having paid less than them
if you claim your 5 euro discount with the code ISOC.
Register at: http://www.har2009.org
CAN I REGISTER FOR NEXT YEAR ALREADY?
Sure you can. Just go to http://isoc.nl/registratie as you did before.
The event will take place on January 14th 2009, and the venue will be
Pakhuis de Zwijger.
