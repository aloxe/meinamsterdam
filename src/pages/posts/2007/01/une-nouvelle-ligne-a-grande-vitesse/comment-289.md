<p>
On the auto salon AutoRai NS, the Dutch national railway company introduced its new brand <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/meteorry/439041743/">NS Hispeed</a> for it's international trains. This includes the highspeed train from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, Breda, Antwerp and Brussels which will be introduced later under a different name. But also Thalys and ICE will be joining this brand in the Netherlands. In 2009 trains will run up to 250 kilometers per hour (Thalys 300 km/h) in the Netherlands. Somewhere in 2007 they will start a service with normal trains on the new line (with reduced speed).
