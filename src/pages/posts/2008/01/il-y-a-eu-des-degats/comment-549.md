If you come to my photostream or my website www.amstersam.com regularly, you'll know that I am a 'little' bit upset about the fact that Amsterd@m is being sweeped clean of all those lovely, smutty, dirty, cool, naughty, unique features that used to make it the best city in the world...maybe I'm suffering from a severe case of male PMS?! It's all good :))

P.s. It seems that somebody had beef with the worlds smallest prostitue...see her unshattered window here <br/>
