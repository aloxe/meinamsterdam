<p>I've posted an update on the Goosebery work we've done in June, and about what happens in the coming months. You can read it all on the <a href="http://gooseberry.blender.org" title="http://gooseberry.blender.org">http://gooseberry.blender.org</a> production blog.</p>
<p>In short:<br />
End of July we'll have the director, concept artists and storyboarders in the studio, which is the start of our Open Production environment as well. We'll be using Blender Cloud to store, version and collaborate, so you'll be getting it all!</p>
<p>Meanwhile we're implementing a high quality administration and payment backend, to make it simpler to handle the subscriptions, product sales, sponsoring and customer support. Francesco is coordinating this, he will keep you informed about the status of that.</p>
