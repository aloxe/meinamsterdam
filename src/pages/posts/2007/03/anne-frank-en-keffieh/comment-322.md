<p>Hello Alix, I saw your comment on my blog and I don't have a clear answer for you. I don't know much about the stencil but noticed that it popped up around Amsterdam about a year and a half ago. I spotted it in maybe four or five locations and I liked it very much because it made me think of peace between the Jewish and Palestinian people.</p>
